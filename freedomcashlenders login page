Online lending networks act as a bridge between you and the direct lender. You submit one prequalifying form through the network, which sends your information to all of its partnered lenders throughout the U.S.

Those lenders use automated underwriting processes to make near-instant decisions on your loan. In many cases, qualified applicants receive multiple loan offers to choose from in a matter of minutes.

Once you complete your online paperwork, which can take less than one hour to finish, the lender will transfer your funds to a linked checking or savings account and you will have your money in one business day or sooner. You may see the funds in your account the same day if you apply early in the day.
